    # If agent knows the location of object, the agent can use this function to navigates to the object. 
    # If agent does not know the location of object, the robot should use the Explore(robots, dest_obj) to find the object.

    # The function captures only those objects that are within the agent's line of sight.
    
    # Example: 
    # <Instruction> Go to the apple(The memory contains the location of apple). 
    # Python script: 
    # GoToObject(robot,'Apple')
    pass

    # The agent must first find the object (via Explore/GoToObject) before picking it up.
    # The argument is the exact object name (e.g. 'Apple', not 'CounterTop').

    # Example:
    # <Instruction> Go get the apple on the kitchen counter.

    # GoToObject(robot, 'Apple')
    # PickupObject(robot, 'Apple')

    # Python script: 
    # Explore(robot,'Sink')
    # GoToObject(robot,'Sink')
    # PutObject(robot,'Sink')

    # Example:
    # <Instruction> Turn on the faucet to wash the apple.
    # Python script:
    # GoToObject(robot, 'Sink')
    # SwitchOn(robot, 'Faucet')

def SwitchOff(robot, sw_obj):
    # Turn off a switch.
    # The agent must be adjacent to the object before calling SwitchOff.

    # Example:
    # <Instruction> Turn off the light.
    # Python script:
    # Explore(robot, 'LightSwitch', available_positions)
    # GoToObject(robot, 'LightSwitch')
    # SwitchOff(robot, 'LightSwitch')

    #Example: 
    # <Instruction> Get the apple in the fridge. 
    # Python script: 
    # Explore(robot,'Fridge')
    # GoToObject(robot,'Fridge')
    # OpenObject(robot,'Fridge')

    #Example: 
    # <Instruction> Slice an apple. 
    # Python script: 
    # Explore(robot,'Knife')
    # GoToObject(robot,'Knife')
    # PickupObject(robot,'Knife')
    # Explore(robot,'Apple')
    # GoToObject(robot,'Apple')

    # This function assumes the interaction object is already off and the agent has navigated to the object.

    # Example:  
    # <Instruction> Turn on the lamp.
